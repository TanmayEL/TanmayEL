## About Me

I am a Computer Science graduate with a specialization in **AI and Machine Learning**, and over three years of professional experience building and maintaining production-grade software systems. Previously at Accenture, I worked on backend systems, automated validation pipelines, and data integrity frameworks supporting large-scale financial applications.

My interests span **software engineering, applied machine learning, computer vision, and distributed systems**, with a focus on building reliable, scalable, and well-structured solutions. I enjoy working on projects that combine strong engineering fundamentals with applied ML research.

I am seeking **full-time Software Engineering / AI Engineering roles starting Feb 2026**.

## My Pinned Projects

I learn best by building. Below are selected projects that reflect my interests in software engineering, machine learning, and scalable systems.

| Project | What's the Big Idea? | Tech Stack |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Multimodal Code Summarizer](https://github.com/TanmayEL/multimodal-code-summarizer)** <br/> *(Work in Progress)* | An end-to-end system for automated pull request summarization that combines **visual and textual representations of code changes**. Leverages a hybrid **Vision Transformer (ViT)** + **CodeBERT** architecture, enhanced with **LLM API integration** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to ground summaries in repository context, commit history, and code semantics. | `Python`, `PyTorch`, `Hugging Face`, `Vision Transformers`, `CodeBERT`, `OpenCV`, `LLM APIs`, `RAG`, `FastAPI`, `Streamlit` |
| **[Multi-Temporal Urban Change Detection]((https://github.com/TanmayEL/urban_change_detection))** <br/> *(Work in Progress)*  | A computer vision pipeline for detecting and visualizing **urban growth from time-separated satellite imagery**. Implements classical CV baselines and is being extended toward geospatial-aware processing with vectorized outputs and interactive visualization. | `Python`, `OpenCV`, `NumPy`, `Geospatial CV`, `Raster Processing`, `Streamlit` |
| **[Decentralized File Sharing Platform (IPFS)](https://github.com/TanmayEL/decentralized-file-sharing-ipfs)** | A secure, full-stack file-sharing platform that removes centralized storage by leveraging **IPFS** for peer-to-peer file distribution, with authenticated access and metadata management. | `React`, `Node.js`, `MongoDB`, `IPFS`, `Pinata`, `JWT` |
